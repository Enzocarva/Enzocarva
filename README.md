# <p align="center">< üëã Hey there, I'm Enzo! /></p>
I am a 22 year old computer science student from üáßüá∑ at the University of Miami. I am passionate about programming, and I am always looking to learn from others!

üíª I am currently working on a few different projects on my own but I would love to collaborate with others, so please reach out if you want to work on a project together!

üìà I am most familiar with Java at the moment, but I am also learning Python, C, HTML, and CSS. I'm excited to continue learning and upgrading my skillset within the world of software development, meeting other developers and learning and working with them!

ü§ù Please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate or just chat on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enzo-carvalho-872218230/).

‚úÖ Thank you for checking out my profile!
